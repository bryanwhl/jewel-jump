## Jewel Jump

Challenge your friendships and play mind games with your friends! Jewel Jump is a local turn-based multiplayer game for 4 players, playable with just one keyboard. The goal of the game is to collect as many jewel as possible. Every round, each player chooses a direction to jump to. If more than one person jumps on the same tile, none of these players will receive any jewel from the tile. Collect power-ups to help yourself or hinder others from winning. 

Be careful, the scoreboard can be deceiving... Losing is winning!
